## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, you should have the following installed on your development machine.

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

You should also have a Microsoft work or school account in a Microsoft 365 tenant that has [enabled custom Teams app sideloading](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading). If you don't have a Microsoft work or school account, or your organization has not enabled custom Teams app sideloading, you can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program) to get a free Office 365 developer subscription.
